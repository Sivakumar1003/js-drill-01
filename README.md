# JavaScript Drill - Enhanced Exercises with Methods

This branch enhances the JavaScript exercises by incorporating reusable functions to promote code modularity, reusability, and cleaner code.
```

## Project Structure
```
    ├── test 
    │ ├── test1.js # Test file for problem1.js 
    │ ├── test2.js # Test file for problem2.js 
    │ ├── test3.js # Test file for problem3.js 
    │ ├── test4.js # Test file for problem4.js 
    │ └── test5.js # Test file for problem5.js 
    ├── problem1.js # Exercise on basic variable manipulation 
    ├── problem2.js # Exercise on control flow and loops 
    ├── problem3.js # Exercise on functions and scope 
    ├── problem4.js # Exercise on array methods 
    ├── problem5.js # Exercise on object manipulation 
    └── database.js # Contains sample data if used in exercises
```


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
    git clone -b withmethods https://github.com/Sivakumar1003/js-drill-01.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd js-drill-01
    ```
3. **Run the test files using Node.js**:
    ```
    node test/test1.js
    ```
    Replace `test1.js` with any other test file (`test2.js`, `test3.js`, etc.) to test the respective problem.

## Enhancements in this Branch
* **✅ Reusability**: Common logic is moved to utils.js for reuse across multiple problems.
* **✅ Modular Code Structure**: Functions are organized to reduce redundancy and improve clarity.
* **✅ Maintainability**: Improved readability facilitates easier debugging and future extensions.
* **✅ Test Folder**: Each problem has its corresponding test file in the test folder.
